Many databases use heuristics to choose the best index for a given query. The database needs to collect additional usage data (-&gt; overhead) and might still choose the wrong index. It also makes creating a query slower.</p><p>Nobody knows your data better than you, the developer. So you can choose the optimal index and decide for example whether you want to use an index for querying or sorting.</p><h3 id="do-i-have-to-use-indexes-where-clauses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-have-to-use-indexes-where-clauses" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Do I have to use indexes / where clauses?</h3><p>Nope!
